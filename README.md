# Restaurant Rating Prediction and Analysis
This project involves building a predictive model to estimate the aggregate rating of restaurants based on various features such as cuisine type, location, price range, and other available attributes. Additionally, it includes tasks to analyze customer preferences, visualize the data, and gain insights into the factors affecting restaurant ratings.

# Tasks:

## Predictive Modeling:
- Build regression models to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.

## Customer Preference Analysis:
- Analyze the relationship between the type of cuisine and the restaurant's rating.
- Identify the most popular cuisines among customers based on the number of votes.
- Determine if there are any specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.

## Data Visualization:
- Create visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar plot, etc.).
- Compare the average ratings of different cuisines or cities using appropriate visualizations.
- Visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.

# How to Run:
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required libraries.
- Run the Jupyter notebook "Cognify Level 3 tasks.ipynb" to analyze the data, build predictive models, and visualize the results.
